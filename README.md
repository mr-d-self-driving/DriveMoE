Welcome to the official implementation of DriveMoE. Follow the instructions below to set up your environment, prepare data, and start training.

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Prerequisites
- CUDA Version: $\ge$ 12.1 (Required)
- Python: 3.10+ (Recommended)

### 2. Setup
Clone the repository and install the dependencies in editable mode:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU/DriveMoE.git
cd DriveMoE
conda create -n drivemoe python=3.10
conda activate drivemoe
pip install -e .
```

## 📂 Data & Checkpoint Preparation

### 1. Download Assets
Please download the following components to their respective directories:
- Datasets: Download the [Bench2Drive Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/rethinklab/Bench2Drive) and [Camera Labels and Scenario Labels](https://huggingface.co/rethinklab/DriveMoE) into the data/ directory.
- Model Weights: Download the [PaliGemma pre-trained weights](https://huggingface.co/google/paligemma-3b-pt-224) into the ckpt/ directory.

### 2.Preprocessing
After organizing the files, run the preprocessing script to prepare the training data:
```bash
bash script/generate_data.sh
```
For OPEN-LOOP evaluation (testing with ground truth history), you must be set HORIZON_SIZE to 20 to ensure fair comparison with baseline methods. For CLOSED-LOOP evaluation (testing with predicted history), it can be set to any value based on your requirements. 

💡 **Note:** Changing `HORIZON_SIZE` requires clearing the previous experiment cache. Simply run: `rm -r exp/b2d_action`

## 🚄 Training & Evaluation

### Start Training
Launch the training process using the provided script:
```bash
bash script/training/train_drivepi0_closed_loop.sh          # train drivepi0
bash script/training/train_drivemoe_stage1_closed_loop.sh   # train drivemoe stage1
bash script/training/train_drivemoe_stage2_closed_loop.sh   # train drivemoe stage2
```

### Evaluation
We support both Open-loop and Closed-loop evaluations. For detailed evaluation steps, please refer to [Evaluation on Bench2Drive](docs/evaluation.md).
